Nort Clicker is now open source!
you can edit or use that for base for your clicker.

Remember if you edit the code and publish it you need to tag me for not getting copyrighted.

If you build the clicker and it dosent work thats my bad becouse am wanted to add source on github (files too big). Full source with all working:https://www.mediafire.com/file/jfaa4wcbtqeqnqr/Nort.zip/file
